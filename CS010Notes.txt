Ch.2 Variables/Assignments
- In a program, a variable is a named item.
- An assignment statement assigns a variable with a value.
- Increasing a variable's value by 1 is known as incrementing the variable.
- A variable declaration is a statement that declares a new variable, specifying the variable's name and type.
- An assignment statement assigns the variable on the left-side of the = with the current value of the right-side expression.
- An identifier is a name created by a programmer for an item like a variable or function.
- A reserved word is a word that is part of the language, like int, short, or double; aka keyword.
- Reserved words can't be used as identifiers.
- C++ reserved words or keywords:

- An expression is a combination of items.
- A literal is a specific value in code.
- An operator is a symbol that performs a built-in calculation.
- An expression evaluates to a value.
- Floating-point # is real number. Floating-point refers to decimal points being able to appear anywhere (float) in #.
- A variable declared as double stores a floating-point #.
- A floating-point literal is # with fraction part.
- Dividing a nonzero floating-point # by 0 results in infinity or -infinity. Outputs inf or -inf.
- If dividend and divisor in floating-point division are both 0, division results in "not a number"; outputs nan.
- A floating-point literal using scientific notation is written using an e preceding the power of 10 exponent.
- Each memory location is composed of bits; processor stores # using base 2, known as binary #.
- A standard math library has about 20 math operations.
- A function is a list of statements executed by invoking function's name, known as function call.
- Function input values are called arguments.
- Math library is <cmath>.
- Common math functions are sqrt(x), pow(x, y), fabs(x).
- Type conversion is conversion of one data type to another.
- Compiler automatically performs several common conversions between int and double types, such authomatic conversion known as implicit conversion.
- A type cast explicityly converts a value of one type to another type; use static_cast<type>(expression).
- Char variables store numbers.
- ASCII is early standard for encoding characters as numbers.
- The language uses an escape sequence if there is no visible character.
- Common escape sequences:
    - Newline: \n
    - Tab: \t
    - Single quote: \'
    - Double quote: \"
    - Backslash: \\
- A string is a sequence of characters.
- A string literal surrounds a character sequence with double quotes.
- User #include <string>.
- The function getline(cin, stringVar) gets all user text on the current input line up to the new newline character (removed from input but not put in stringVar).
- const keeps a variable's value from changing.
- An initialized variable whose value cannot change is called a constant variable.
- Integer numeric data types:
    - char, short, long, long long, int.
- Floating-point numeric data types:
    - float, double.
- Overflow occurs when value being assigned to variable is greater than maximum value variable can store.

Ch.3 Branches
- A branch is a program path taken only if an expression's value is true.
- A logical operator treats operands as being true or false and evaluates to true or false.
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
Ch.4 Strings/Loops 1
- Each string character has a position number called an index starting with 0.
- s1.append(s2) appends s2 to s1.
- find(item) returns index of first item occurrence, else returns string::npos.
- substr(index, len) returns substring starting at index and having len characters.
- push_back(c) appends c to end of string.
- insert(indx, subStr) inserts string subStr starting at index indx.
- replace(indx, num, subStr) replaces characters at indices indx to indx+num-1 with copy of subStr.
- Including cctype library via #include <cctype> provides access to several functions for working with characters. ctype stands for character type.
- isalpha(c) returns true if c is alphabetic.
- isdigit(c) returns true if c is digit.
- isspace(c) returns true if c is whitespace.
- toupper(c) changes c to uppercase.
- tolower(c) changes c to lowercase.
- A loop is a program construct that repeatedly executes the loop's statements while loop's expression is true.
- Each time through a loop's statements is called an iteration.
- A while loop is a program construct that repeatedly executes a list of sub-statements while the looop's expression evaluates to true.
- An infinite loop is a loop that never stops iterating.
- A sentinel value is a special value indicating the end of a list.

Ch.5 Loops 2
- A for loop is a loop with three parts at the top: a loop variable initialization, a loop expression, and a loop variable update.
    - for (initialExpression; conditionExpression; updateExpression) {
        
        }
- ++ is known as the increment operator; -- is the decrement operator.
- ++i (prefix) increments i first then evaluates the result, while i++ (postfix) evaluates the result first and then incremenets i.
- The rand() function returns a random integer each time the function is called in the range 0 to RAND_MAX.
- The integers generated by rand() are known as pseudo-random because each time a program runs, calls to rand() yield the same sequence of values.
- For the first call to rand() the function uses a built-in integer known as the seed.
- The default seed is 1; the seed can be changed using the function srand().
- One way to get a different seed for each program run is to use the current time as the seed; time().
- A nested loop is a loop that appears in the body of another loop. Nested loops are commonly referred to as the inner loop and outer loop.
- A do-while loop is a loop construct that first executes the loop body's statements, then checks the loop condition.
    - do {
        
        } while (loopExpression);

Ch.6 Functions 1
- A function is a named list of statements.
    - A function definition consists of the new function's name and a block of statements.
    - A function call is an invocation of a function's name, causing the function's statements to execute.
- A parameter is a functino input specified in a functino definition.
- An argument is a value provided to a function's parameter during a function call.
- A function may return one value using a return statement.
- A return type of void indicates that a function doesn't return any value.
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
Ch.7 Functions 2
- Each function call creates a new set of local variables, forming part of what is known as a stack frame. A return causes those local variables to be discarded.
- Normal parameters are pass by value, meaning the argument's value is copied into a local variable for the parameter.
- A pass by reference parameter does not create a local copy of the argument, but rather the parameter refers directly to the argument variable's memory location. Append & to parameter's data type.
- A reference variable is a variable type that refers to another variable.
- The name of a defined variable or function item is only visible to part of a program, known as the item's scope.
- A variable declared outside any function is called a global variable.
- A function declaration specifies the function's return type, name, and parameters, ending with a semicolon.
- A function declaration is aka a function prototype.
- The preprocessor is a tool that scans the file from top to bottom looking for any lines that begin with #, a hash symbol.

Ch.8 Vectors 1
- An array is a special variable having one name but storing a list of data items with each item being directly accessible.
- Some languages use vectors.
- Each item in an array is an element.
- In an array, each element's location number is the index.
- A vector is an ordered list of items of a given data type.
- Each item in a vector is an element.
- Vector declaration: vector<dataType> vectorName(numElements);
- A vector's size() function returns the number of elements.
- A vector's elements are automatically 0 during declaration.
- vector<int> myVector(#1, #2); creates a vetor named myVector with #1 elements each with value #2.
- vector<int> myVec = {1, 2, 3}; creates a vector of 3 integer elements initialized with values 1, 2, and 3.
- Use push_back to append a new element to the end of an existing vector.
- back() returns vector's last element.
- pop_back() removes last element.
- Resize vectors with resize(#).

Ch.9 Vectors 2
- The vector copy operation performs an element-by-element copy of a vector.
    - vectorB = vectorA
- The == operator compares vector's element-by-element, called a vector equality operation.

Ch.10 The Internet and the Web
- The Internet is a commection of billions of computers using the Internet Protocol's communication rules.
- A computer communicates via the Internet by sending a packet, comtaining information like an address for a destination computer, the data size, and the data.
- The basic low-level rules for communicating data over the Internet are called the Internet Protocol (IP).
- A router is a specialized computer in a network that receives a packet from a computer/router and sends that packet to another computer/router on a path towards the packet's destination.
- Most people use an Internet Service Provider (ISP), a company that provides connections to the Internet, usually via cable lines, digital phone lines, or satellite.
- A modem is used for communication between a home/office computer and the ISP's computers, which connects to the Internet.
- An IP address is a computer's unique address on the Internet.
- A typical address is 32 bits, divided into four 8-bit groups, each group often written as a decimal number.
- All websites could be reached by the computer system's IP address.
- A domain name is a name for an IP address, like cnn.com.
- When a computer sends a packet using a domain name over the Internet, the first step is to contact a DNS server to convert the domain name to an IP address.
- DNS is short for Domain Name System.
- Some computers have a static IP address, meaning the address doesn't change.
- Some computers have a dynamic IP address.
- Computers are typically assigned a new dynamic IP address each time it is turned on or is newly connected to the Internet.
- An ISP allows computers to connect with the Internet.
- Sending a computer's data requires electrically combining with a different electronic signal capable of travelling over the ISP's line, a process known as modulation.
- A modem (modulator/demodulator) performs the required combining/uncombining of computer data and electrical signals over an ISP's line.
- A modem typically connects to a computer using a communcation protocal known as Ethernet over an Ethernet cable.
- A router is commonly placed after a modem to route packets from the ISP's line to the appropriate computer among many in a home/office and sometimes routing directly between those computers.
- A Wi-Fi router uses wireless technology to communicate with computing devices over short distances of up to 66 feet.
- Wi-Fi refers to a wireless computer networking standard known as IEEE 802.11.
- If home network fails, turn off stuff starting from farthest from the wall. Then turn on starting closest to the wall.
- Computer networks evolved in the 60s to let computers communicate info with each other.
- The Internet is the most popular computer network today.
- FTP (file transfer protocol0 was an early way for transferring files.
- The web is a more convenient way for computers to communicate files.
- The web involves:
    - Text files, known as HTML files, containing links to other text files.
    - A program, known as a browser, for viewing HTML files.
    - A set of rules, known as the HTTP protocol, for transferring HTML files among computers.
- HTML stands for hyper-text markup language.
    - Hyper-text means the text has links to other text and other stuff.
- HTTP stands for hyper-text transfer protocol.
- The web was originally called the World Wide Web, hence www.
- The web has over 1 billion websites and 1 trillion web pages.
- A web search seeks web pages that best match user-typed words.
- A search engine is a website that does web searches.
- A search engine determines the "best" matching pages using web-search matching criteria.
- A default search engine is the engine a browser uses for searches done via the browser's search box or URL box.
- For speed, search engines pre-visit web pages and create an index of words pointing to specific pages.
- A web crawler is a program that pre-visits web pages to build an index.
- Using quotes searches for those words in that order.
- Using a minus before a word excludes sites that have that word.
- Including site:.ending restricts searches to domains with that ending.
- Including filetype:type limits results to files of that type.
- Searching on scholar.google.com searches academic articles rather than the web.
- A domain name is a name for an IP address.
- Domain names and IP addresses are managed by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).
- A domain name registrar is a company authorized to reserve domain names.
- Domain names are hierarchical.
- A domain name belongs to one of numerous top-level domains like .com, .net, .org, .edu, and .gov.
- There are second-level domains, usually an organization's name.
- Third-level and further level domains refer to sub-computer systems local to an organization, like cs.stanford.edu or www.
- Cybersquatting is registering a domain name in the hopes of selling later for a profit.
- Domain names are most commonly seen in URLs.
- A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the location of a file on the web.
- The http part of the URL refers to hyper-text transfer protocol used for communicating web pages.
- https uses encryption for secure transfers such as passwords or credit card numbers.
- If a web server is reached but the specific requested page isn't found, the server returns a 404 error message, code number for page not found.
- A link on a web page is text that can be clicked to jump to another web page.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is language that styles web pages.
